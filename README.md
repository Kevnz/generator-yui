# Generator yui
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/tomlane/generator-yui.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tomlane/generator-yui)

A generator for Yeoman for generating a base template for YUI/H5BP.

This is a very early work in progress generator. I created it as one of many projects I plan to take up over the next few weeks/months before I start univserity. Yes, it isn't the best code in the world but it has (so far) been an interesting learning experience for me.

Do feel free to help out though, help and guidance will be much appreciated. :D <3

# (Lots) TODO

- Get it working
- Write some more tests
- Implement easy version control (for version bumping)
- Allow use of local builds/copies of YUI
- Write some demo YUI code
- Support front-end YUI and Node.js YUI (?)

## Getting started
- Make sure you have [yo](https://github.com/yeoman/yo) installed:
    `npm install -g yo`
- Install the generator **locally**: `npm install generator-yui`
- Run: `yo yui`
